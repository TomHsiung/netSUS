# netSUS
An open source software update service

# Notice
1) The netSUS package for Ubuntu is not perfect. Its built-in DHCP component will conflict (version 5.0.1) with other DHCP service like isc-dhcp-server, resulting the latter fails to run. 
2) There is no uninstaller for netSUS, which means once you install it, you cannot clearly remove it and restore your server to status before.
